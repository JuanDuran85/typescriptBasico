/**
 * Strategy Pattern
 *
 * Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all
 * information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or
 * queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations. Also, is a design pattern that lets you define
 * a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable
