## F.I.R.S.T principles
These are principles, not rules, that we can follow when writing tests:
 - Fast: Unit test should be fast, faster tests, faster feedback.
 - Independent: Unit test should be isoleted from one another, external environment.
 - Repeatable: Same result with the same input.  
 - Self-validating: After the test completes, it's results are cleare.
 - Thorough: Cover all the cases, paths, scenarios, happy, bad and edge cases.
